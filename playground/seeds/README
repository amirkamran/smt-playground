Seeds:
------

Seeds are tiny scripts to setup an experiment.
Each experiment goes through three phases:

1. Init (directory created, vars written, most notably TAG)
(the directory gets renamed now)
2. Prepare (sources checked and cloned, ./command created)
3. Run (lengthy computation, usually on the cluster)


Steps 1 and 2 are handled by (a local copy of) the seed. Step 3 is handled by
./command as created by the seed.

Seeds are required to:
* Within phase 1 (init):
- create TAG and VARS
- not store the full pathname anywhere yet, the directory will be renamed
- stop if INIT_ONLY is set
* Withing phase 2 (prepare):
- use environment vars to check and clone any sources
- prepare the script command

Commands (created by seeds) are required to:
- touch DONE once finished
