Seeds:
------

Seeds are tiny scripts to setup an experiment.
Each experiment goes through three phases:

1. Init (directory created, vars written, most notably TAG)
(the directory gets renamed now)
2. Prepare (sources checked and cloned, ./command created)
3. Run (lengthy computation, usually on the cluster)


Steps 1 and 2 are handled by (a local copy of) the seed. Step 3 is handled by
./command as created by the seed.
