This file lists known problems of eman, eman seeds and corpman
--------------------------------------------------------------

* Default vs. empty variables may cause problems in cloning.
  Variables of individual steps can be explicitly blank or they can be
  undefined, taking the default value. Eman always stores all variables in
  eman.vars, but when cloning tracebacks, it searches for steps with a given
  set of variables *without* consulting the default values in the seeds. It can
  thus happen, that a new step is inited in cloning instead of reusing an
  existing one. The existing step is not recognized as matching to the vars
  listed in the traceback, because they differ in non-mentioned variables (with
  default values).

* Two means of dependencies cause confusion.
  corpman knows how to construct trees of steps to prepare the corpus it
  was asked for. These trees then become visible in eman tracebacks. However,
  cloning of these tracebacks is not well tested and I'm afraid that eman
  unnecessarily regenerates many of these corpman steps.
  What's worse: having two copies of the same corpus confuses corpman.
