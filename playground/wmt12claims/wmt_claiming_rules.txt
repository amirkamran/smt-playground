Rules for reporting improvements of UFAL MT systems
participating in the WMT 2012 shared task.
---------------------------------------------------

(1) Anyone can contribute.

(2) Your improvements will be rewarded financially.

(3) A reserved amount of money will be divided among all
participating developers accordingly to the impact of their
contributions upon the translation quality.

(4) Dividing the money among the contributors is a responsibility of
the evaluation board formed by Zdenek Zabokrtsky and Ondrej Bojar. Both Ondrej
and Zdenek can make their own claims as well but they will not get any share of
the money.

(5) The rewards will be largely (but not solely) based on the
reported translation quality measures. Improving other desirable
properties of the UFAL MT systems or their supporting infrastructure
('common good', in short) will be rewarded too, provided that such
changes are directly related to the WMT shared task.

(5) Only those contributions claimed under the following rules will be
taken into account. Contributions having no real impact on what
gets finally submitted to WMT'12 might be excluded from the evaluation.

(6T) In order to claim a new contribution in the tecto translation in Treex,
please do the following:

  (6T.1) Improvements are to be claimed exclusively via
  svn logs of the Treex repository, so that the claims are
  synchronized with the real status of the svn repository.

  (6T.2) Use treex/devel/en2cs/Makefile for your experiments

  (6T.3) Make sure that your new improvement affects the default
  translation scenario executed by this Makefile (i.e., no special
  settings are needed).

  (6T.4) Make sure that you used an updated version of the system
  for a relative evaluation of your improvement.

  (6T.5) Choose a reasonable granularity of your claims (relevent
  especially for the 'common good' claims); ideally, each claim should
  correspond to a relatively completed and logically delimited subtask,
  not just to a tiny code fix.

  (6T.6) Claim your contribution by cut'n'pasting and filling
  one of the two following YAML-style forms into the svn log:

# ------- WMT12CLAIM-type1 --------
descr:
bleu_before:
bleu_after:
nist_before:
nist_after:
changedsent:
subj_improved_perc:
subj_worsened_perc:
# -----------------------------

# ------- WMT12CLAIM-type2 --------
descr:
common_good:  # applicable values: tiny, medium, big
# -----------------------------

  (6T.7) The estimates of percentage of improved or worsened
  sentences can be based only on a sample of at least 20 randomly
  chosen changed sentences; the two numbers do not have to sum
  up to 100, since the effect on some sentences can be neutral
  (they are comparably good or bad as before)

  (6T.8) Immediately after comitting the claim, create directories
  claim<revnumber>/before/ and claim<revnumber>/after/ in
  /net/projects/tectomt_shared/data/archive/wmt12_claims
  and archive the complete snapshots of the two compared translation
  experiments in there (the directories generated by the Makefile).

(6M) In order to claim a new contribution in the Moses translation,
please do the following:

  (6M.1) For your experiments, use your own checkout of 'statmt':
    svn co https://svn.ms.mff.cuni.cz/svn/statmt/trunk statmt
    cd statmt

  (6M.2) Improvements are to be claimed exclusively via svn logs of the statmt
  repository, so that the claims are synchronized with the real status of the
  svn repository.

  (6M.3) There are two types of claims:
  a) relative improvement over the current best setup (for a given language
     pair, most importantly en->cs).
  b) contribution to the 'common good'

  (6M.4) For the 'relative improvement', a script will be added to make the
  claim. The script will be called probably like this:
    cd playground
    svn up wmt12claims
      # to ensure up-to-date state and comparison relative to the current best

    wmt12claims/prepare-claim s.mert.123456.2012-01-01
    # where s.mert.123456.2012-01-01 is the top-level step where you reached
    # a score better than the current best for the given language pair

    # now you'll be asked to manually evaluate some sentences

    # If the evaluation looks good (i.e. you have some improvement in manual
    # scoring or a large enough improvement in the automatic scoring), commit
    # the claim:
    svn ci

    # You may also give up and revert the claim:
    cd wmt12claims; svn revert

  (6M.5) The 'relative improvement' claim has to have the svn log message of
  this YAML-style form:

# ------- WMT12CLAIM-type1 --------
descr:
bleu_before:
bleu_after:
nist_before:
nist_after:
changedsent:
subj_improved_perc:
subj_worsened_perc:
# -----------------------------

  (6M.6) For 'common good' claims, the commit message of the respective files
  (or simply a last commit in the row), use this form as the svn log message:

# ------- WMT12CLAIM-type2 --------
descr:
common_good:  # applicable values: tiny, medium, big
# -----------------------------
  
  
  Please choose a reasonable granularity of your claims (relevent especially
  for the 'common good' claims); ideally, each claim should correspond to a
  relatively completed and logically delimited subtask, not just to a tiny code
  fix, unless it helps a lot.
